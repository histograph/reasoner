# histograph-reasoning

Tool to find and create relations between PITs from two data sources, based on their attributes (name, type, geographic location).

Current version is for creating relations files on a client, but needs a local instance of Elasticsearch with Histograph data, as well as access to PITs files.

A later version will run on server as a standalone agent, and automatically update relations when data sources change.
